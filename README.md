# Grace MPICH

### Branches

The branch `rccl_allreduce` is the "clean" branch that I'm using for the PR. This involves changes that integrate RCCL's Allreduce backend into MPICH.

The branch `rccl_comp` includes debugging comments and changes to the composition algorithms. I used this to make my graphs.

I don't really know what's going on in this main branch. I used it to fix merge conflicts and stuff but don't use this branch!
